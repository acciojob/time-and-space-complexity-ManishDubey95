	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      Time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime in relation to input
      size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, handling larger
      inputs quickly. Big O notation quantifies time complexity. It's vital for
      choosing optimal algorithms in various applications, focusing on speed and
      scalability for better performance.

      <b> Space Complexity</b>
      Space complexity, known as "Space Complexity," gauges an algorithm's
      memory usage as input grows. It's often expressed as O(n), where n
      represents input size. Optimizing space complexity ensures efficient
      memory utilization in algorithms, vital for resource-efficient
      applications and managing large datasets without excessive memory
      consumption.
